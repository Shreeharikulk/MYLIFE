   <h3><b> PART-1: MY COLLEGE LIFE(JAN-2023-MARCH)</b></h3>
    My after-college (12th) story is an interesting and more kinda complicated aspect of my life, so the year was 2023, I was studying 12th std so well start with January: when our pre-boards were going on, and after some days JEE mains results were declared. I don't remember the date but the results were released at night @2-3 am, at that time I and my sister were studying and I had to have a Sanskrit exam the next day so I called my sister and said the results outlet check together and face it at that time was pretty confident that I'm gonna score more than 99+ percentile for sure!! As soon we opened it my total score was 98%ile which was good, but I was crying for the first time for getting lower marks than expected and my sister was celebrating. My parents were sleeping but I didn't bother them to show my result which was a mistake. The next day I told my parents about the result and they were happy about it my friends were happy, but I didn't tell my college but there were some rumors someone in our 2nd class which is the hostel had scored more than 99+. I went to college to write my exam and our sir was asking every topper student about the result I was not a popular "typical teacher" student so I was not asked about the result. I wrote the exam and returned home 30 minutes earlier btw when I was writing my exam our chem mam came to me and asked what is your result...I was like its less mam, she was like okay. There was my friend who knew my result and idk Maybe sir asked him who scored the highest...that time he told me my name he scored more than 98%lie sir and other teachers were shocked so they called me and he was " Eno Shreehari yest cholo maadi ala heelbek eel madla ning college valag yala huddakli kathev ba clg ig" and I was happy later my mam called to nd she was like "You are the topper of both college" and later my principal called me and he were sharing a great bond so he was like " Shreehari bhal cholo maadbitidia congo hintav yala cholo kelsa bhal late heeltiya beedu" and later they called my parents and they were happy too. After this ofc, the whole college knows me now, I was not very interested in boards I was more of a competitive kid who knew how to solve complex sums in seconds in a much easier way. More people including my friends were feeling jealous it was more about hate rather than appreciation, I think it was of course the feelings you know, we all have worked hard for the National exams, suddenly a rise of average student on boards who topped the competitive exam it was a shame for them!! Later on, I then topped in 2nd attempt too by the time I had cracked many more exams like NSEP, and NSEA. There were more politics in our college the topper awards were given only to favorite students, so I was not given anything I was not so into it behind the awards, my ultimate aim was to make my parents, cousins, and family happy this was my ultimate goal. At that age, you can do the most is, to study hard and make your parents proud of you and what you did. After all these me and my cousins traveled a lot, I myself had a lot of trips. The counseling started as  I was more interested in research so there was a lot of drama in the house there was a lot of fighting going on between me and my parents i toured them a lot and I accepted my mistakes. <br><br>
